      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Front End Web Developer with a passion for building innovative solutions. <br/> <br/>My expertise includes front-end development using HTML, CSS, React, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Wordpress with some understanding of SQL, NoSQL, Node.js, ExpressJS, Firebase, MongoDB. <br/> <br/>My greatest strength as a Front-End Developer is the ability to build websites using any visual builder, such as Elementor, Oxygen, Webflow, or Beaver Builder. Throughout my career, I’ve stood out for my adaptability to change and new challenges.
<br/> <br/> I'm passionate about web design — from the first Figma wireframe to seeing the site live. I have a strong eye for visual design and enjoy the entire creative process: crafting visual identities (color palettes, logos, typography) and developing websites across various platforms. I’m capable of building complete brands that are both visually cohesive and functionally solid.
 <br/> <br/> An example of this is Saredi Jewelry, a project where I designed the logo, created the brand identity, and built and launched the entire website.
<br/> <br/> In my free time, I enjoy exercising, being outdoors, traveling, keeping up with the latest developments in technology, and experimenting new ways to improve my skills.
<br/> <br/>If you want to learn more about my experience or collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to reach out.
